										<h1>Education and Poverty</h1>

										<center><h2>Does Access to Education Reduce Poverty?</h2></center>
								<hr>
								<!-- Text stuff -->
									<h2>Overview</h2>
									<h3>Motivation</h3>
									<p>According to The World Bank, education is one of the strongest instruments of reducing poverty, delivering 
                                        large returns in terms of income (<a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/education/overview#:~:text=By%202030%2C%20our%20target%20is,blocks%20for%20all%20other%20learning.">source</a>). 
                                        The link between high education levels and low levels of poverty are well established, but is this correlation without causation? Or is the 
                                        reduction in poverty the cause that allows a higher number of young people to be educated to a higher level that their predecessors?
                                        </p>
									
									<h3>Objective</h3>
									<p>To determine if increasing education enrolment is cause of lowering poverty levels. And if so, in what time frame does the change in 
                                        education rates decrease the poverty levels of a nation, and what levels of education have the highest impact on decreasing the proportion 
                                        of people living in poverty.

									<h2>Data Sourcing</h2>
									The World Bank collates a variety of metrics provided by its member nations, and uses these data to further 
									accurately estimate other metrics. All these data are provided for public use in accordance with the World Bank's 
									<a href="https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/public-licenses" target ="_blank">Public License</a>, and are used in accordance with the cited 
									<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" target ="_blank">Creavitve Commons License</a>. The following data 
									were used from The World Bank's data catalouge:
										<li><a href="https://data.worldbank.org/topic/economy-and-growth?view=chart" target ="_blank">Economy and Growth</a></li>
										<li><a href="https://data.worldbank.org/topic/education?view=chart" target ="_blank">Education</a></li>
										<li><a href="https://data.worldbank.org/topic/poverty?view=chart" target ="_blank">Poverty</a></li>
									The data are provided with covering all metrics from 1960 to 2022 where available, and include metadata on how the 
									information was sourced or generated by The World Bank.<br>
									Data regarding the value and distribution of International Aid for education was sourced from the 
									Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's 
									<a href="https://stats.oecd.org/qwids/" target ="_blank">Query Wizard for Development Statistics</a>.
									<hr>

									<h2>Data Cleaning</h2>
									<h3> Missing Data</h3>
									<em><a href="https://github.com/MDHigg/global-Poverty-and-Education/blob/main/00%20Scripts/01.01%20Data%20Cleaning%20Economic%20Dataset.ipynb" target ="_blank">Full Python code on GitHub</a></em><br>
									<p>
										The World Bank provides 254 indicators for the economic level and growth of nationn. On studying the metadata file provided 
										four of these factors were potentially required to meet the aims o the study:
										<li>GNI per capita growth (annual %)</li>
										<li>GNI per capita (constant 2015 US dollars)</li>
										<li>GDP per capita growth (annual %)</li>
										<li>GDP per capita (constant 2015 US dollars)</li>
									</p>
									<p>	
										<span class="image right">
												<img src="images/economy missing data.png" alt="" />								
										</span>
										The data for each year (1960 to 2022) was reviewed to determine the number of missing data points. The level for 
										data required was set at 30%, which equated to fewer than 319.2 entries in a given year. The data from 1996 was the first year to 
										fall below this target of no more than 30% missing, 2022 also lacked enough data to have a dependable statistical basis for analysis. 
										Therefore, the dataset was trimmed to include on the the years 1996 - 2021.
										</code>
									</p>
									<p>
										Once the years with significant data for analysis were identified the missing values were interpolated using the following Python code:<br>
										<code>WB_econ_GDP_GNI_interpolated = WB_econ_GDP_GNI_interpolated.interpolate(method='linear', axis=1, inplace=False, limit_direction = 'both', limit_area=None)</code><br>
										Data points between two known values are estimated using a linear trend. For data outside the range of known values 
										the values are filled with either the last or next known value depending on if it is at the start of end of the range.
									</p>
									<p>
										Finally, the data were organised to follow tidy data principles. The four indicators and the year were changed to individual 
										variables. The images below show the layout of the data before and after the data tidying process:

									<h2>Analysis</h2>
									<h3>Correlation Heatmap</h3>
									<p>	
										<span class="image left"><img src="images/correl matrix.png" alt="" /></span>
										A correlation matrix was produced to determine the relationships between national poverty measures at the 
										three key rates, as set by The World Bank, and the enrolment rate of young people in school. this showed that there are strong 
										negative correlations (blue) between the rate of enrolment and the rate of poverty. With the enrolment rate at the 
										secondary school level having the strongest relationship (light blue) with the rates of poverty. Furthermore, 
										all rates of education enrolment had the strongest relationship with the lowest poverty level (<em>US$2.15 per day, 2015 equivalent</em>). 
										This means that the higher the rate of enrolment in education the lower the rate of poverty across a nation.
									</p>
									<h3>Geographic Analysis</h3>
										<p>Maps of the spread of poverty and education enrolment were created using Folium, and an example is given below of the 
										global poverty rates at fewer than $6.85 per day in 2015 are shown below. The full anaysis can be found at 
										<a href="https://github.com/MDHigg/global-Poverty-and-Education/blob/main/00%20Scripts/5.01%20Geographic%20Visualization%20Folium.ipynb" target ="_blank">GitHub</a></em>.<br>

										</p>

									<h3>Machine Learning: Clustering</h3>
									<p>	<span class="image right">
										<img src="images/elbow curve.png" alt="" />
										</span>
										Once correlation and location were determined, the Year, Poverty Rate, Primary Enrolment, and Secondary Enrolment Rates 
										were compared and grouped into siliar types by clustering. Clustering looks to group the data into a given number of 
										subtypes, such that fr any given number of groups all data is as colse as possible to the mean of its group. 
										An <em>elbow test</em> was performed by comparing the data with a range from 1 to 9 clusters, and the <em>elbow</em> of the 
										graph is the point at which there is a significant drop in the gradient (see right). The last observable change in gradient 
										happens at k=3, implying that the data should be grouped into three clusters, and there is no advantage to having 
										greater than three clusters.<br>
									</p>
									<p>	<span class="image left">
										<img src="images/k_means clustering.png" alt="" />
										</span>
										Once the number of clusters is determined, the SciKit Python library is used to group the data. The scatter graph 
										shows the Poverty and Secondary Enrolment Rates of all countries in 2015, coloured by their assigned cluster. There are very clear 
										regions for each cluster, with limited overlaps between groups.

								<h2>Insights</h2>
								<ul>
								<li>Education and Poverty are linked to one another, with the countries that have the highest rate of poverty experienceing the 
									lowest levels of educaiton enrolment.</li>
								<li>The enrolment in secondary educaiton has a stronger link to the rate of poverty in a nation than primary education, 
									implying that futhering education is an improtant factor.</li>
								<li>There are broadly three groups of nations when comparing educaiton and poverty levels. This was explored in greater depth 
									in the final analysis dashboards, and aligns with The World Bank's designation of countries as <em>high</em>, <em>middle</em>, or 
									<em>low</em> income nations.</li>
								</ul>
