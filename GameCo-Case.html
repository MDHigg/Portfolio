                                            The visualisation to best display regional sales trends was determined to be a 
                                            line graph, with the proportion of annual sales rather than absolute. This made each year 
                                            comprable to the others, as the total sales volume annually was inconsistent.<br>
                                            Sales prior to 2007 were excluded as they did not reflect current buying trends.<br>
                                            The data chosen, and the method of presentation gives a clear indication to the marketing team 
                                            about the future dominance of Europe over North America as the centre of video game purchasing.

                                            Genre sales was shown for the most recent year, in absolute terms. Giving context to the 
                                            relative sales by genre to allow GameCo to understand which types of games were the best investment.<br>
                                            The stacked bar allowes the stakeholders to understand how best to divide their budget across the three largest 
                                            market regions once the genres of game they are maketing is known.

                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Europe is now the largest market and growing. GameCo must increase marketing in Europe to capitalise.</li>
                                        <li>North American is still the second largest market, but it is continuing to decrease its marketshare. 
                                            Marketing should regularly review the need and effectiveness of North American marketing strategies.</li>
                                        <li>Action and Shooter games are most popular worldwide, strong investment in these genres will have 
                                            global reach due to their international appeal.</li>
